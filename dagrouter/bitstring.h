/* get a variable-length val out of a bitstring, starting at the

 * the expected format is: length spec, optionally followed by the val

 *
 * the length spec is a sequence of N set (1) bits and always
 * terminates at the first cleared (0) bit. N can be zero.
 *
 * [1...]0
 *
 * the value of N maps to the length of the value. this mapping is
 * provided in the "numSetBits2Len" array, where the array indices are
 * values of N, and the corresponding array elements are the lengths
 * of the value.
 *
 * if the length of the value is 0, then there is no value. the length
 * must be <= 32.
 *
 *
 * "bsLen" is the total length in bits of the bitstring bs. it is an
 * error if processing would have to go past the length.
 *
 * "arraySize": size of the "numSetBits2Len" array.
 *
 * "ret_val": if not NULL, this will the value, if applicable, from
 * the bitstring.
 *
 * "ret_lenSpecNumBits": if not NULL, will be the number of bits in
 * the length spec (INCLUDING the zero-terminator).
 *
 * "ret_totalNumBits": if not NULL, will be the total number of bits
 * occupied by this value, INCLUDING the length spec.
 *
 * returns: -1 on errors, -2 if there's no value, 0 if there is a
 * value.
 *
 * examples:
 *
 * suppose fromIdx = 0, and numSetBits2Len[] = {3, 0, 1,}, in other
 * words, if there are 2 set bits, i.e., "110", then the value is only
 * 1 bit.
