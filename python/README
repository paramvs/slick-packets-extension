this directory contains code related to the DAG selection, encoding
formats, and their evaluation.


approach2.py implements the DAG selection.

codec4.py implements the "Default encoding" in the paper, and
codec2.py the "Direct encoding." (code3.py is an earlier version of
codec4.py.)

evalCombo.py is used to run the evaluation ("runeval" command) as well
as post-process (e.g., "gencdf" command) the pickled result files to
obtain final stats.
