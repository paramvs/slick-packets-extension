def encode(dg, primaryPath, virtualDetourPaths, localLinkIDs, optimize1,
               s='Src', d='Dst',
               roundUpToMultipleBits=1, # NOTE!!! this is pointer alignment.
               useLinkIdLenPrefix=True,
               localLinkLabelLens=None,
               returnActualEncoding=False):
    '''

    we have found pointer alignment of 1 performs best. alignment of 1
    means there is no wasted padding, but the pointers have to be
    larger. but proly the wasted padding hurt more.
    
    "useLinkIdLenPrefix": if true, then link labels are variable
    length and use prefix-codes. if false, then all of a node\'s link
    labels use same length, and this length is from
    "localLinkLabelLens" map.

    "localLinkLabelLens": required if "useLinkIdLenPrefix" is
    false. this must be a map from node to label length.

    NOTE: "offset" and "pointer" are used interchangably.

    "returnActualEncoding": if true, will also return the actual
    encoding as a bitstring.BitString object, and the list of node
    names in the order they are encoded/appear in the encoding.

    a "current ptr" value of zero means at
    the destination (router). so in all paths, primary of detour, the
    nodes before the destination router have to contain a ptr of zero.

    also, the destination router does not need to be part of the
    conding because it has no out-links.

    this is trying to reduce encoding size by
    placing nodes that are adjacent in the graph adjacent in the
    encoding, so that each of those nodes can eliminate one
    out-neighbor\'s offset ptr (it can instead include the offset from
    itself, or not include an offset at all and let the router compute
    it).

    more specifically, if a node has two successors, we can place one
    successor node (1st or 2nd--doesnt matter) right after this node
    and thus its "successor" bitstring does not need to contain an
    offset ptr. the other "successor" bitstring has to contain an
    offset ptr.

    if a node has only one successor, then of course that sole
    successor bitstring can skip the offset ptr if the successor Node
    can be placed immediately after this Node.

    So....

    a) group all the nodes in the primary path and all nodes in the
    penultimate primary node\'s detour paths.

    specifically, primary node N will have as its 1st successor
    bitstring its primary successor, ie, primary node N+1, and can
    skip the offset pointer. its 2nd successor bitstring will be its
    detour node, which will require an offset pointer.

    then, since we do not encode the destination router, the
    penultimate primary node will have as its 1st successor bitstring
    an offset ptr value of zero. which means, its 2nd successor, if
    applicable, can be part of the group as well, and the bitstring
    can skip the pointer as well.

    then, we can continue to group in the remaining virtual nodes of
    the penultimate primary node\'s detour path.

    b) then among the detour paths, find the longest sequence of
    [nodes that do not already appear in any group], then group
    them. should have a threshold under which it is no longer worth
    creating a group.

    * <len of ptr><current ptr><Node>[<Node>...]

    - len of ptr: "0" for 4 bits, "10" for 6 bits, "110" for 8 bits,
      "1110" for 10 bits, "11110" for 12 bits, and "111110" for 16
      bits.

      we are using one fixed size ptr throughout a header, so this
      doesnt apply, but if we allow each node to have a different ptr
      size, then the nodes with the higest indegrees should be placed
      earlier in the header to keep the offsets small, because the
      offsets will be referred to by many other nodes.


    * <Node> = <# of successors><Successor>[<Successor>...]

    - # of successors: 1 bit


    * <Successor> = <len of ID><ID><contains ptr?><ptr (if "contains ptr" is true>

    - len of ID: 1 bit: "0" for 4 bits, "1" for 8 bits

    - contains ptr?: 1 bit: "0" for no, in which case, this node is
      part of a "bunch". so, the router is expected to compute the
      offset of the node that follows it into the global "current
      ptr".

    - ptr: its len is from the first part of the header.


    algorithm: the tricky part is to find out the smallest sufficient
    length of ptr. this is clearly recursive because ptrs are part of
    the packet.

    so for now use this iterative algo:

    - assume the length needs to be 4 bits.

    - add everything to get the total length of the packet in number
      of "roundUpToMultipleBits" of bits (WITH individual padding, ie,
      each <Node> should be aligned to "roundUpToMultipleBits" number
      of bits)

    - if that is larger than 4 bits can address, try again with 8
      bits, etc
